# Protect-Purdue-Bot

## Inspiration
We were inspired to create a project designed to help people at Purdue given the unique situations of 2020.
## What it does
The chat bot is programmed to assist the user with any concerns they may have for COVID-19 (in general and on Purdue's campus). 
## How we built it
We "bought" a number hosted by Twilio and used Twilio to build the tasks for the chat bot and train it as well. We wrote up Python code to actually run the tasks and linked that code back to Twilio.
## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we ran into was that in the project's current state, the bot only works with the number registered to the Twilio account used to set up the bot (Veer's). This is due to the fact that we have a trial account for Twilio. We would have to spend money to give everyone access to the bot.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating something that can useful to people at Purdue. Helping everyone stay safe during COVID-19 was one of our main goals in designing this project. We're also proud to have successfully linked the Python code with Twilio with no major errors.
## What we learned
Through this project, we learned the basics of Twilio, and how we can connect the Python code back to Twilio to create a chat bot. We learned how the chat bot is able to improve itself through the training and giving it more responses.
## What's next for Protect Purdue Bot
We could look to improve our chat bot by running and training it more so that the model becomes more accurate. We could also brainstorm more tasks to add so that we can increase the amount of things it can do.
